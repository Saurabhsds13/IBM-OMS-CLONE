infomation regarding project

1.to get the product by the customer location
	we have implemented in the ProductServiceImpl.java in the service folder

2.to place the order 
	this implementation is in the OrderServiceImpl
	




## note 

what you have to work again that this api will update the tables accordingly for that check the default records and 
updated record after the put request

need json data to keep the data 


[
{
    "productId":1,
    "quantity":1
},{
    "productId":7,
    "quantity":2
},{
    "productId":10,
    "quantity":4
}

]

report is : order and order details are working fine but the inventory having some issue
go for the different method as we have for order and order_details
